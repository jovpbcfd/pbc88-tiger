One player grabbed that full **৳39,925** even though he came **5th**. With only 71 people in, things got super tight. Every spin counted. If you're new to PBC88 or someone who plays slots regularly, this story will get you excited. Let me tell you what happened, what the game is, and how you can try for your own big win.

## What Exactly is Anubis Rising? The Game That’s Taking Bangladesh by Storm

For anyone who hasn't tried it yet — Anubis Rising is this fun online slot that really clicks with us Bangladeshis. It's quick, full of action, and has that cool ancient Egypt feel with the jackal god Anubis.

You spin the reels and suddenly Anubis pops up, eyes shining, and starts multiplying your wins like mad. It's a high-risk, high-reward game with a nice desert temple look — golden beetles, big Anubis statues, and bonus rounds that can go wild. The RTP sits around **96.5%**, which is pretty good for something this exciting. Every spin keeps you on edge, like something huge is just about to drop.

Here in Bangladesh we like games that give fast excitement but also pay you if you hang in there. That's why so many people play Anubis Rising after iftar in Ramadan or during weekend cricket breaks. Looks amazing on phone — smooth even when you're stuck in traffic going to Gulshan or New Market.

Best thing? Everything is in **BDT (৳)**. Deposit Taka, win Taka, cash out to bKash, Nagad or Rocket — no headache with dollars or conversions. PBC88 really made it feel local.

## The Tournament That Everyone is Talking About: 71 Players, One Massive Jackpot

Now the juicy part — that recent Anubis Rising tournament.

PBC88 ran a special one with only **71 players** (mostly from Bangladesh, few from nearby). Everyone paid an entry fee and jumped in to score as many points as possible — big wins, bonus rounds, those Anubis multipliers.

They guaranteed **৳39,925** for the top spots. That's serious money here — enough to really help with bills or family stuff. It lasted a few hours, leaderboard changing every minute. Players from Rajshahi, Khulna, Dhaka going up and down like a tense cricket game.

With just 71 people, no hiding. One bad streak and you're out of the top. One good scatter hit and you're climbing fast.

Right at the end, top 10 were separated by tiny points. The guy who got **5th** (let's call him Rahim Bhai to keep it private) was sitting in 7th with 20 minutes left. Then — bang! — Anubis triggered three times in one bonus, 50x multiplier. Jumped straight to 5th and locked **৳39,925**.

Can you imagine the shout when that "৳39,925 credited" message came? Moments like that make you love playing.

## Why This 5th Place Win Feels Like a Victory for All of Us

Coming 5th out of 71 and still taking home **৳39,925**? That's not pure luck. Rahim Bhai played smart — didn't blast everything on every spin. He waited for good spots, raised bets when things felt hot, stayed calm during dry spells.

Shows you don't need 1st place to win decent money on PBC88. Prizes go deep — even 10th got something nice. Good for students, shop owners, office guys who play small during lunch.

In our country where money is tight, wins like this mean a new phone for the kids, extra help at home, or just enjoying some street food without worry.
