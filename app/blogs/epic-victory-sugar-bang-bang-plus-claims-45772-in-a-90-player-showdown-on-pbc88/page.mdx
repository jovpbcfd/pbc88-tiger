## Key Strategies That Led to the ₹45,772 Payout

Getting second in a 90-player game isn't just luck. It takes smart planning, understanding people, and staying focused. Here are some things that probably helped Sugar Bang Bang Plus:

- **Bankroll Management:** They started with a good amount of ৳ Taka and didn't spend it all at once. Setting limits per hand kept them in the game even after some losses.
- **Position Play:** Where you sit matters in poker. Being last to act lets you see what others do first. This player used that to grab extra chips slowly.
- **Bluffing Mastery:** You can't win every hand, but bluffing at the right moment makes others fold. They pulled off some great bluffs against stronger hands.
- **Adaptability:** As players drop out, the game changes. They switched from loose play early to careful moves later.
