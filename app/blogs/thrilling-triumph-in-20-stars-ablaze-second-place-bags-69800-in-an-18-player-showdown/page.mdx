Picture this: someone came in second in an 18-player tournament and pocketed **৳69,800**! Yeah, that actually happened not long ago. Whether you're someone who's played for years or you're just starting out, this story shows why so many of us here in Bangladesh are hooked on this game. Let's break it down nice and simple.

## What is 20 Stars Ablaze? A Fun Space Slot

**20 Stars Ablaze** is basically an online slot that drops you right into a beautiful starry sky full of shiny symbols and big win chances. The folks who made it know how to build games that feel exciting and keep you coming back. You get five reels spinning with twinkling stars and colorful space clouds in the background — every spin feels like blasting off.

The name says it all. There are **20 paylines**, and when they hit, it's like stars shooting across the screen. The "Ablaze" part comes from those wild fire animations in the bonus games — they make every win feel extra special. For us in Bangladesh, it's great because the rules are easy. No need to overthink. Just pick your bet in Taka, press spin, and enjoy.

What makes it stand out? It has a solid **RTP around 96%**, so over time, a decent amount of money comes back to players. That's huge when every Taka matters. The game can be calm for a bit, then boom — big hits. That's why that **৳69,800** second place in the 18-player event felt so awesome. Tournaments turn regular play into a fun contest where Bangladeshi players compete for top prizes and bragging rights.

The theme is all space and stars. You see flaming stars, comets, planets, plus regular card symbols dressed up with glow. Wilds are like exploding supernovas that fill in for other symbols. Scatters give free spins that can multiply what you win. If you like looking at the night sky or just cool space stuff, this game hits the spot.

## The Big Win: How Someone Grabbed ৳69,800 in Second Place

This win is what got us writing. In a recent tournament on PBC88, 18 players jumped in to fight for cash. It was tough — people from Bangladesh and other places spinning hard. One smart player landed second and walked away with **৳69,800**. Not bad at all!

Tournaments usually work by collecting points from your wins over time or spins. With just 18 people, every move counted. Good bankroll control and knowing when to push for bonuses made the difference. That player probably nailed the free spins round, where multipliers stack up and turn small bets into huge payouts.

This isn't a one-off. The game often pays out nicely in events like this. Sure, first place gets more sometimes, but second at **৳69,800** proves you can still win big without taking the crown. For folks here, it's encouraging — you can play from Dhaka, Chittagong, or anywhere with internet, using Taka straight away, no exchange nonsense.

The best part? The entry wasn't crazy expensive. Shows big wins aren't just for rich players. Patience and smart choices beat blind luck a lot of times. When stories like this spread on forums or social media, the whole community gets pumped.
