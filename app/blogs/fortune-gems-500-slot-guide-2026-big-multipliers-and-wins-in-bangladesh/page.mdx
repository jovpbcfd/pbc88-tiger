## How Fortune Gems 500 Works: The Multiplier Reel and Nudge Feature Explained

Fortune Gems 500 keeps things straightforward with a 3-reel setup plus a fourth bonus reel for multipliers. You win by landing three matching gems on any of the five paylines, and that extra reel can add a multiplier to your payout – anything from 1x up to 500x.

The cool part is the Ex Nudge feature. When it lands, the multiplier reel nudges multiple times (up to 50!), grabbing extra multipliers that add up or multiply together for bigger totals. There's also an Extra Bet option that costs more per spin but removes low multipliers, giving you better shots at higher ones.

It's low to medium volatility, so you get wins fairly often, keeping sessions fun without too many dry spells. Players on PBC88 love how quick and rewarding it feels. Start with small bets to see the multipliers in action – one nudge chain can turn a regular win into something nice.

- Match gems on the main reels for base payouts.
- Watch the fourth reel for instant multipliers.
- Hit Ex Nudge for chaining boosts.
- Try demo mode on PBC88 to practice first.

Simple setup, but those multipliers make every spin exciting!
